# Esolangs
Esoteric languages by yours truly.

Should these be seperate repos? Probably. Too late.

Each folder contains both an interpreter and some example programs.

I make no claims of cleanliness or value or anything like that here -- this is mostly just a dumping ground for esolangs.

Go wild, I guess.
